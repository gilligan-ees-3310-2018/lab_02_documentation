This repository contains an introduction to working with data sets in R,
and especially emphasizes the role of a suite of tools calle the
`tidyverse`.

The file `lab_02_documentation.Rmd` is an exact copy of the file I used to make the documentation for this lab on the course web site. 
It's here for you to inspect if you want to see how I made that document, and for you to play with if you want to reproduce the examples 
of data manipulation from that document. All the necessary data files are in the `_data` folder, and you can make your own copy of this 
project in RStudio by following these steps:

* Click on the green "Code" button on the GitHub page for this project.
* Below where it says "Clone," click on "HTML" and then click on the clipboard icon to copy the address of the GitHUb repository to your 
  clipboard.
* Next, create a new project in RStudio (from the "File" menu, choose "New Project," and then click on "Version Control"). Select "Git" 
  and paste the GitHub address for your project into the "Repository URL" box. Then click on "Create Project."
* Once RStudio creates the new project, you can open the `lab_02_documentation.Rmd` file and play with it.
